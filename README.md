1.  Clone the repository ```git clone https://github.com/Satish-Chilloji/Learning_AL_with_Data.git```
1.  Create the Conda environment using commands : ```conda create -n "LAL" python=3.11```
2.  Activate the Conda environment : ```conda activate LAL```
3.  Install the required libraries: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4.  Run below commands to create the synthatic classisfication data and produce the synthtic training data for Regression Trainig using Iterative and Random Approach.
    1.  ```python run_LAL_iterative.py```
    2.  ```python run_LAL_random.py```
5.  Go through the run_LAL.ipynb jupyter notebook to understand the results for the approach with comparision with other methods.
